# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Current release branch (main) and the latest tagged version receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report privately rather than opening a public issue.

Email: <security@example.com> (replace with a real contact)

Include:

- A description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce.
- A minimal proof of concept (if possible).
- Impact assessment.
- Suggested remediation (optional).

## Disclosure Process

1. We acknowledge receipt within 5 business days.
2. We investigate and determine impact/severity.
3. We may request additional information.
4. A fix is prepared and merged.
5. We publish an advisory (if warranted) and credit reporter unless anonymity requested.

## Scope

Application code and supplied configuration. Third-party dependencies are out of scope unless our integration introduces the issue.

## Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action for good faith, non-destructive security research within this policy.
